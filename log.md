# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 22, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Powered through some more functional programming JavaScript modules with FreeCodeCamp.org.

**Thoughts:** Functional programming is still a difficult concept for me, but I'm getting through it. Starting up intermediate algorithm scripting later tonight.
